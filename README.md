## Backstory
It started in 2020. My apartment building which normally had an elaborate trick-or-treating setup had been reduced to a few tables outside in the shared garden. I saw these people in the suburbs testing out these long tubes from their porches to the front yard for a socially distanced candy experience. From that, I got an idea. What if I just had to sit there and the candy dispensed itself? Obviously, this isn’t a unique idea, vending machines have probably existed since the middle ages or something, but I thought it would be a fun simple project.

## Constraints
- I wanted to use different candies. I didn’t want to make a gumball machine, I wanted something that can take a jumbo bag of assorted candies and dispense them.
- Candy is soft
  - Mechanisms that have any chance of smushing or damaging the candy won’t work
- Cheap.
  - I wanted to use things i already had as much as possible. I would maybe spend $10-$15 on my first attempt
  - This means my design would largely rely on cardboard, hot glue, 3d printed parts, and some electronics I had lying around
